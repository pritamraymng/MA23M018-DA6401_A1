Description of assignment:
A neural network to classify the images from Fashion-MNIST dataset. The experiments were being tracked by wandb.ai

Roadmap:
1. Question 1: Download the Fashion-MNIST data and plot one sample image from each class, File name: problem1.py, Link: https://github.com/pritamraymng/MA23M018-DA6401_A1/blob/main/problem1.py
2. Question 2: Implement the feedforward neural network and output the probability distribution over 10 classes,  File name: problem2.py, Link: https://github.com/pritamraymng/MA23M018-DA6401_A1/blob/main/problem2.py
3. Question 3: Implement the backpropagation algorithm with different optimizer algorithm,  File name: problem3.py, Link: https://github.com/pritamraymng/MA23M018-DA6401_A1/blob/main/problem3.py
4. Question 4: Implement hyperperameter tuning by keeping 10% data for validation( I am using 100 sweeps), File name: prob4.py, Link: https://github.com/pritamraymng/MA23M018-DA6401_A1/blob/main/prob4.py
5. Question 5: Show best accuracy on the validation set by the wandb generated plot, File name: prob4.py, Link: https://github.com/pritamraymng/MA23M018-DA6401_A1/blob/main/prob4.py
6. Question 6: Parallel co-ordinate plot, File Name: prob4.py, Link: https://github.com/pritamraymng/MA23M018-DA6401_A1/blob/main/prob4.py
7. Question 7: Confusion matrix for the best model after hyperparameter tuning, File name: question7.py, Link: https://github.com/pritamraymng/MA23M018-DA6401_A1/blob/main/question7.py
8. Question 8: Compare cross entropy loss and squared loss, File name: problem8.py, Link: https://github.com/pritamraymng/MA23M018-DA6401_A1/blob/main/problem8.py
9. Question 10: Best 3 hyperparameter combination, File name: problem10.py, Link: https://github.com/pritamraymng/MA23M018-DA6401_A1/blob/main/problem10.py


The codes are mostly ran in '.ipynb' format. The '.ipynb' code links are also added in the wandb report.
